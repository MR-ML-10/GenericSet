# **GenericSet**

A custom implementation of a generic set data structure in Java. The `GenericSet` class allows you to create a set of any data type, perform fundamental set operations, and handle duplicates efficiently. The project is designed to provide a deeper understanding of set implementations and operations while demonstrating object-oriented programming principles in Java.

## **Project Status**
ðŸš§ **Under Progress**  
This project is currently under development. While core functionalities like adding elements, checking for duplicates, and performing set operations are implemented and tested, additional features and optimizations are planned for future updates.

## **Features**

### **Core Functionalities**
1. **Add Elements**
   - Adds elements to the set while maintaining the set property of unique elements.
2. **Check for Containment**
   - Verifies if an element exists in the set.
3. **Union**
   - Combines two sets, returning a new set containing all unique elements.
4. **Intersection**
   - Returns a new set with elements common to both sets.
5. **Size**
   - Retrieves the number of unique elements in the set.
6. **String Representation**
   - Provides a string representation of the set for easy debugging.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Java**: Core programming language for implementing the data structure.
- **JUnit**: For unit testing to ensure correctness and reliability of the implementation.
